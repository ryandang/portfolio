          In my free time, I'd like to take my camera on a long hike. Photography is something that I 
          recently pick up and I find myself really enjoy doing it.

          My favourite recreational activity to do is volleyball. It's a great sport that requires great team work and 
          communication. It's also a great way to make new friends.
